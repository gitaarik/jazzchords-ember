    <h3 class="heading3">Measures</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      A box represents one measure (commonly 4 beats), which can contain one or
      more chords. The space a chord gets inside a box indicates the number of
      beats it has to be played; a full box is 4 beats, half a box is 2 beats and
      quarter a box 1 beat:

    <h3 class="heading3">Chords</h3>

    <h3 class="heading3">Alternative bass note</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      A chord can have an alternative bass note. Instead of playing the root
      note as lowest tone in the chord, you play an alternative note. In this
      case the chord name and symbol will be followed by a slash ( / ) and the
      alternative bass note. For example, this is a E7 chord with a B as the
      bass note:
